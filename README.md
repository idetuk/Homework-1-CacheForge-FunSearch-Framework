# Homework-1-CacheForge-FunSearch-Framework
This assignment introduces an LLM-guided, evolutionary workflow (CacheForge) for discovering cache replacement policies that improve average IPC across representative workloads.

**Final Policy**: LIME (LLM-Inferred Memory Exploiter)
**Key Result:** Achieved a 1.042 Geomean IPC Speedup over the LRU baseline in single-core tests.
**Budget Compliance:** The original high-performance policy was 20.5 MB over the 64 KiB budget. A complete Pruned Version is provided and analyzed in the report to satisfy area constraints.

### Required Artifacts

1.  **`lime.cc`**: The final, high-performance, over-budget policy generated by FunSearch.
2.  **`lime_pruned.cc`**: The budget-compliant version (metadata < 64 KiB).
3.  **`report.pdf`**: The final IEEE-style analysis document.
4.  **`reproduce.sh`**: Script to compile and run the baseline and the best LIME policy.

### Reproduction Instructions

This project was built and validated using the ChampSim framework on a Unix/Linux environment (e.g., VCL HPC Cluster).

#### Prerequisites

1.  A C++ compiler (g++ >= 11).
2.  GNU `make`.
3.  ChampSim traces (the five single-core traces and four multi-core traces used in the project).

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [YOUR-REPO-LINK]
cd [YOUR-REPO-FOLDER]
